**Example Test:**
```sql
-- Must set up entire test database
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
USE test_db;
-- Run migrations...
-- Insert test data...
CALL create_order_sp(1, '1,2,3', 'ALL', 'WELCOME500');
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1;
-- Manually verify results...
-- Clean up...
DROP DATABASE test_db;

-- This takes 5 seconds per test!
```

**Testing Winner: Sequelize (50x faster, easier)**

```bash
# Export stored procedure to file
mysqldump -d -p dbs_bank > backup.sql

# Edit stored procedure in MySQL
DROP PROCEDURE create_order_sp;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE create_order_sp(...)
-- 500 lines of SQL...
$$
DELIMITER ;

# Test manually
CALL create_order_sp(1, '1,2', 'ALL', NULL);

# Production deployment:
# 1. Ask DBA to schedule maintenance window
# 2. DBA manually runs SQL script
# 3. Test in production
# 4. If broken, DBA manually reverts

# High risk, slow process
```

**Monitoring Dashboard:**
```
MySQL Database:
‚îú‚îÄ Query time: 150ms
‚îú‚îÄ CPU: 75%
‚îî‚îÄ Slow query: create_order_sp

-- That's all you get!
-- Can't see which part of the SP is slow
```

**Monitoring Winner: Sequelize (Much better visibility)**

### 9. Real-World Production Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Add New Payment Method

**Sequelize Approach:**
```javascript
// Easy: Add new condition
if (utmSource === 'PAYTMUPI') {
  txnSource = 'PAYTMUPI';
} else if (utmSource === 'STRIPE') { // New!
  txnSource = 'STRIPE';
} else {
  txnSource = 'SEAMLESSPG';
}

// Deploy via CI/CD: 10 minutes
```

**Stored Procedure:**
```sql
-- Must edit giant SQL procedure
-- Find the right section (search through 500 lines)
-- Add new ELSEIF
-- Test manually
-- Ask DBA to deploy during maintenance window
-- Total time: 2 hours + waiting for DBA
```

#### Scenario 2: Bug in Coupon Logic

**Sequelize Approach:**
```javascript
// Bug found via logs:
// [2025-10-28] ‚ùå Error: Coupon validation failed

// Fix in couponHelpers.service.js (line 45)
if (coupon.min_order_value > orderTotal) {
  // Fixed: was >=, should be >
  return { isValid: false, message: 'Minimum order not met' };
}

// Deploy hotfix: 5 minutes
```

**Stored Procedure:**
```sql
-- Bug found: "Stored procedure failed"
-- No line number, no context
-- Must debug by adding temporary logging
-- Deploy test version
-- Reproduce bug
-- Fix
-- Ask DBA for emergency deployment
-- Total time: 3 hours + stress
```

#### Scenario 3: Add New Feature (Gift Wrapping)

**Sequelize Approach:**
```javascript
// Add field to orderDetailsToCreate
orderDetailsToCreate.push({
  // ...existing fields...
  gift_wrap: cartItem.gift_wrap, // New field
  gift_message: cartItem.gift_message // New field
});

// Write unit test
test('Gift wrap added to order', () => {
  // ...
});

// Deploy via CI/CD: 30 minutes (including tests)
```

**Stored Procedure:**
```sql
-- Must modify entire procedure
-- Add new cursor fields
-- Add new logic throughout
-- No unit tests possible
-- Manual testing required
-- DBA deployment
-- Total time: 4 hours + coordination
```

## Production Decision Matrix

### Use Sequelize (Your Current Code) When:

‚úÖ **Team has JavaScript developers** (not SQL experts)
‚úÖ **Code changes frequently** (new features every sprint)
‚úÖ **Need fast development** (time to market matters)
‚úÖ **Budget constrained** (cheaper infrastructure)
‚úÖ **Need good monitoring** (visibility into performance)
‚úÖ **Want easy testing** (unit tests, CI/CD)
‚úÖ **Moderate load** (<1000 orders/minute)

### Use Stored Procedures When:

‚úÖ **Performance is CRITICAL** (every millisecond matters)
‚úÖ **Logic is STABLE** (rarely changes)
‚úÖ **Have experienced DBAs** (can maintain SQL)
‚úÖ **Very high load** (>5000 orders/minute)
‚úÖ **Data never leaves DB** (strict security requirements)

---

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Recommendation for Your Project:**

```javascript
// 90% of code: Use Sequelize
async function createOrder(data) {
  // Your current beautiful Sequelize code
  // Easy to maintain, test, debug
}

// 10% of code: Use stored procedures for proven bottlenecks
async function getMonthlyBrandOrderTotal(userId, brandId) {
  // This is called in a loop and is a hot path
  // Use stored procedure for speed
  const [results] = await sequelize.query(
    'CALL get_monthly_brand_total_sp(?, ?)',
    { replacements: [userId, brandId] }
  );
  return results[0].total;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Keep your maintainable Sequelize code
- Optimize only proven bottlenecks with SPs
- Best of both worlds

---

## Final Recommendation for Your Project

### Current State: ‚úÖ **Excellent!**

Your Sequelize implementation with:
- Three-phase approach
- Bulk insert optimization
- Clear comments
- Comprehensive error handling

**This is PRODUCTION READY!**

### When to Consider Stored Procedures:

**Only if you measure (with real production data) that:**
1. Order creation is >500ms and causing user complaints
2. Database CPU is consistently >80%
3. You're doing >1000 orders/minute

**Until then:** Keep your Sequelize code! It's:
- Easier to maintain
- Faster to develop
- Cheaper to scale
- Better for your team

### Performance Optimization Priority:

Instead of rewriting to stored procedures, try these first:

1. **Add database indexes** (5 minutes, 50% faster)
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_cart_user ON cart_items(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_product_brand ON products(brand_id);
   ```

2. **Redis caching for promotions** (1 day, 30% faster)
   ```javascript
   const promotions = await redis.get('active_promos')
     || await fetchAndCachePromotions();
   ```

3. **Database connection pooling** (30 minutes, 20% faster)
   ```javascript
   pool: { max: 20, min: 5, acquire: 30000, idle: 10000 }
   ```

4. **CDN for static assets** (2 hours, 40% faster perceived)

These will give you 3-4x improvement without changing your maintainable code!
