# Why Resetting Coupon is Hard (Explained in Simple Words)

This explains, in the simplest way possible, why the one-loop approach has problems with `remainingCoupon`, even though "we can just reset it."

---

## The Simple Question

**"Why can't we just reset `remainingCoupon` to `couponAmount` after rollback?"**

**Short Answer:** You CAN reset it... but you have to REMEMBER to do it every single time, and that's where bugs happen.

## Let me explain with a real-world story

### üè™ Story: You're at a store with a ‚Çπ600 gift card

**Scenario 1: Three-Phase Approach (Safe)**

You:
1. **Walk around** and pick items (‚Çπ500, ‚Çπ300, ‚Çπ200)
2. **Go to calculator area** and figure out how to split your ‚Çπ600 gift card
   - Item 1 gets ‚Çπ500 off
   - Item 2 gets ‚Çπ100 off
   - Item 3 gets ‚Çπ0 off
3. **Go to cashier** with your plan
4. Cashier says "Item 3 is out of stock"
5. You **throw away your calculation** and start fresh
6. Your gift card is still ‚Çπ600 (you never used it yet!)

**Scenario 2: One-Loop Approach (Risky)**

You:
1. Pick item 1 (‚Çπ500), **swipe gift card**, pay ‚Çπ0, gift card now has ‚Çπ100
2. Pick item 2 (‚Çπ300), **swipe gift card**, pay ‚Çπ200, gift card now has ‚Çπ0
3. Pick item 3 (‚Çπ200), cashier says "out of stock"
4. You want to **undo** items 1 and 2
5. Problem: Your gift card is already use It has ‚Çπ0 left!

Now, the store can give you a **refund** (database rollback), but:
- Your gift card is still showing ‚Çπ0
- You must **manually** ask for a new ‚Çπ600 gift card
- Easy to forget!

## The Computer Version

### ‚úÖ Three-Phase Approach (Current Code)

```javascript
// Phase 1: Collect items
const items = [
  { id: 1, amount: 500 },
  { id: 2, amount: 300 },
  { id: 3, amount: 200 }
];

// Phase 2: Calculate distribution (NO DATABASE, NO REAL CHANGES)
let remaining = 600; // Just for calculation
const plan = items.map(item => {
  const discount = Math.min(remaining, item.amount);
  remaining -= discount; // This is just math, not real
  return { item, discount };
});
// plan = [d!
//   { item: 1, discount: 500 },
//   { item: 2, discount: 100 },
//   { item: 3, discount: 0 }
// ]

// Phase 3: Execute plan
try {
  for (const step of plan) {
    await saveToDatabase(step);
    
    // Item 3 fails here
    if (step.item.id === 3) {
      throw new Error('Out of stock');
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  await rollback();
  // 'plan' is just an array, throw it away
  // Original couponAmount (600) is unchanged
  // On retry, start fresh!
}
```

**Result:** Clean! No confusion! Easy to retry!

### ‚ùå One-Loop Approach

```javascript
let remainingCoupon = 600; // This is THE REAL coupon value

try {
  for (const item of items) {
    // Calculate discount
    const discount = Math.min(remainingCoupon, item.amount);
    
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THE REAL COUPON
    remainingCoupon -= discount;
    
    // Save to database
    await saveToDatabase(item, discount);
    
    // Item 3 fails
    if (item.id === 3) {
      throw new Error('Out of stock');
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback database ‚úÖ
  await rollback();
  
  // But remainingCoupon is still 0! ‚ùå
  console.log(remainingCoupon); // 0 (not 600!)
  
  // To fix, you must manually write:
  remainingCoupon = couponAmount; // Reset manually
  
  // But what if you forget?
  // What if the code changes and someone removes this line?
  // BUGS! üêõ
}
```

## The 5 Real Problems (Simple English)

### Problem 1: You Must Remember to Reset

```javascript
// ‚ùå Easy to forget
try {
  // ... use remainingCoupon ...
} catch (error) {
  rollback();
  // Oops! Forgot to reset remainingCoupon
  // Now it's wrong!
}

// ‚úÖ Three-phase: Nothing to reset
// Calculation is separate from real data
```

### Problem 2: What If Error Happens in Multiple Places?

```javascript
// One loop approach
try {
  for (item of items) {
    remainingCoupon -= discount;
    
    if (item.outOfStock) throw new Error('Stock'); // Error #1
    
    await save(item);
    
    if (limit_exceeded) throw new Error('Limit'); // Error #2
    
    if (brand_cap) throw new Error('Cap'); // Error #3
  }
} catch (error) {
  rollback();
  remainingCoupon = couponAmount; // Reset
  
  // But what if there are MORE errors you didn't think of?
  // What if someone adds a new error in 6 months?
  // Will they remember to check this reset?
}
```

### Problem 3: What If Function Calls Another Function?

```javascript
function createOrder() {
  let remainingCoupon = 600;
  
  try {
    for (item of items) {
      remainingCoupon -= discount;
      
      // Call another function
      await processItem(item, remainingCoupon);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    rollback();
    remainingCoupon = 600; // Reset here
    
    // But what if processItem() also modified it?
    // What if processItem() has its own try-catch?
    // Complex! Hard to track!
  }
}
```

### Problem 4: What If User Clicks Twice Fast?

```javascript
// Global or shared variable (BAD PRACTICE, but happens)
let remainingCoupon = 600;

// User clicks "Submit" twice
Request 1: remainingCoupon = 600 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí Error ‚Üí Reset to 600
Request 2: (running at same time) remainingCoupon = ??? (confusion!)

// Three-phase: Each request has its own calculation
// No shared state = No problem
```

### Problem 5: Hard to Debug

```javascript
// One loop
try {
  remainingCoupon = 600;
  
  // ... 100 lines of code ...
  
  remainingCoupon -= 100; // Line 50
  
  // ... 50 more lines ...
  
  remainingCoupon -= 200; // Line 100
  
  // ... 30 more lines ...
  
  throw new Error(); // Line 130
  
  // Question: What is remainingCoupon now?
  // Answer: You must trace through all 130 lines!
  
} catch (error) {
  // remainingCoupon = ??? (hard to know!)
}

// Three-phase
const distribution = calculateDistribution(600, items); // Pure function
// Easy to test! Easy to debug! Just check this one function!
```

## The Real Answer

### Why Resetting is Hard:

It's not that resetting is **impossible**. It's that:

1. **You must remember** every time
2. **You must reset in all error paths** (there might be many!)
3. **You must reset if code changes** (future developers might not know)
4. **You must reset in nested functions** (complicated!)
5. **You must debug carefully** (hard to track state changes)

### Why Three-Phase is Easy:

1. **Original value never changes** (couponAmount stays 600)
2. **Calculation is separate** (just math, no real changes)
3. **All or nothing** (either save everything or save nothing)
4. **No manual reset needed** (automatic! throw away calculation!)
5. **Easy to debug** (pure functions are predictable)

## Real Example From Your Code

### One-Loop Problem:

```javascript
let remainingCoupon = 600;

for (const cartItem of cartItems) {
  // Item 1: Apply ‚Çπ500
  remainingCoupon -= 500; // Now it's 100
  await OrderDetail.create({ discount: 500 });
  
  // Item 2: Apply ‚Çπ100
  remainingCoupon -= 100; // Now it's 0
  await OrderDetail.create({ discount: 100 });
  
  // Item 3: Check brand cap
  if (brand.order_limit === 'A') {
    const monthlyTotal = await getMonthlyBrandOrderTotal();
    if (monthlyTotal > brand.order_limit_amt) {
      // ‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR! But remainingCoupon is already 0!
      throw new Error('Brand limit exceeded');
    }
  }
}

// In catch block:
// - Database rolled back ‚úÖ
// - remainingCoupon is 0 ‚ùå
// - You MUST write: remainingCoupon = 600
// - If you forget, bug! üêõ
```

### Three-Phase Solution (Your Current Code):

```javascript
const couponAmount = 600; // This NEVER changes

// Phase 2: Calculate (pure function, no changes)
let remaining = couponAmount;
const distribution = items.map(item => {
  const discount = Math.min(remaining, item.amount);
  remaining -= discount; // Just math
  return { item, discount };
});

// Phase 3: Use the distribution
try {
  for (const { item, discount } of distribution) {
    await OrderDetail.create({ discount });
    
    if (brand.order_limit === 'A') {
      const monthlyTotal = await getMonthlyBrandOrderTotal();
      if (monthlyTotal > brand.order_limit_amt) {
        throw new Error('Brand limit exceeded');
      }
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  await rollback();
  // 'distribution' is just data, throw it away
  // 'couponAmount' is still 600 (unchanged)
  // On retry, recalculate from scratch
  // NO MANUAL RESET NEEDED! ‚úÖ
}
```

## Summary in One Sentence

**"Resetting is hard because you must remember to do it in every error case, but three-phase approach doesn't need reset because it never changes the original value in the first place."**

---

## Think of It Like This

### One Loop = Writing on a whiteboard

- You write calculations directly on the board
- If you make a mistake, you must erase and rewrite
- Easy to forget what the original numbers were
- Hard to go back if you erase too much

### Three Phase = Writing on paper first, then whiteboard

- You write calculations on paper (Phase 2)
- You check if everything is correct
- Only then do you write on whiteboard (Phase 3)
- If something is wrong, just throw away the paper
- Whiteboard is never touched until you're sure
- Easy to start over!

---

## Final Takeaway

**Question:** "Can we reset `remainingCoupon`?"

**Answer:** Yes, you CAN. But:
- You must do it **manually** every time
- You must do it in **all error paths**
- You must **remember** to do it when code changes
- It's **error-prone** and **fragile**

**Better Solution:** Don't mutate the original value! Keep calculation separate from data. That's what three-phase does.

**Remember:** 
- ‚úÖ Easy = Don't change original value
- ‚ùå Hard = Change it, then try to reset it

That's why your current three-phase approach is better! üéâ
